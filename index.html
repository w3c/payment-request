      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification describes an API that allows <a>user agents</a>
        (e.g., browsers) to act as an intermediary between three parties in a
        transaction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The payee: the merchant that runs an online store, or other party
        that requests to be paid.
        </li>
        <li>The payer: the party that makes a purchase at that online store,
        and who authenticates and authorizes payment as required.
        </li>
        <li>The <dfn>payment method</dfn>: the means that the payer uses to pay
        the payee (e.g., a card payment or credit transfer). The <dfn>payment
        method provider</dfn> establishes the ecosystem to support that payment
        method.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A payment method defines:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          An optional <dfn data-dfn-for="Payment Method">additional data
          type</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Optionally, an IDL type that the <a>payment method</a> expects to
          receive as the {{PaymentMethodData}}'s {{PaymentMethodData/data}}
          member. If not specified for a given payment method, no conversion to
          IDL is done and the payment method will receive
          {{PaymentMethodData/data}} as JSON.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps to validate payment method data</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Algorithmic steps that specify how a <a>payment method</a> validates
          the {{PaymentMethodData/data}} member of the {{PaymentMethodData}},
          after it is converted to the payment method's [=Payment
          Method/additional data type=]. If not specified for a given payment
          method, no validation is done.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The details of how to fulfill a payment request for a given <a>payment
        method</a> is an implementation detail of a <dfn data-export="">payment
        handler</dfn>, which is an application or service that handles requests
        for payment. Concretely, a payment handler defines:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps to check if a payment can be made</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          How a payment handler determines whether it, or the user, can
          potentially "make a payment" is also an implementation detail of a
          payment handler.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps to respond to a payment request</dfn>:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Steps that return an object or <a>dictionary</a> that a merchant uses
          to process or validate the transaction. The structure of this object
          is specific to each <a>payment method</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn>Steps for when a user changes payment method</dfn> (optional)
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Steps that describe how to handle the user changing payment method
            or monetary instrument (e.g., from a debit card to a credit card)
            that results in a <a>dictionary</a> or {{object}} or null.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This API also enables web sites to take advantage of more secure
        payment schemes (e.g., tokenization and system-level authentication)
        that are not possible with standard JavaScript libraries. This has the
        potential to reduce liability for the merchant and helps protect
        sensitive user information.

      <h2>
        Examples of usage
      </h2>
      <p>
        In order to use the API, the developer needs to provide and keep track
        of a number of key pieces of information. These bits of information are
        passed to the {{PaymentRequest}} constructor as arguments, and
        subsequently used to update the payment request being displayed to the
        user. Namely, these bits of information are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The |methodData|: A sequence of <a>PaymentMethodData</a>s that
        represents the <a>payment methods</a> that the site supports (e.g., "we
        support card-based payments, but only Visa and MasterCard credit
        cards.").
        </li>
        <li>The |details|: The details of the transaction, as a
        <a>PaymentDetailsInit</a> dictionary. This includes total cost, and
        optionally a list of goods or services being purchased. Additionally,
        it can optionally include "modifiers" to how payments are made. For
        example, "if you pay with a card belonging to network X, it incurs a
        US$3.00 processing fee".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once a {{PaymentRequest}} is constructed, it's presented to the end
        user via the {{PaymentRequest/show()}} method. The
        {{PaymentRequest/show()}} returns a promise that, once the user
        confirms request for payment, results in a {{PaymentResponse}}.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Declaring multiple ways of paying
        </h3>
        <p>
          When constructing a new {{PaymentRequest}}, a merchant uses the first
          argument (|methodData|) to list the different ways a user can pay for
          things (e.g., credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.). More
          specifically, the |methodData| sequence contains
          <a>PaymentMethodData</a> dictionaries containing the <a>payment
          method identifiers</a> for the <a>payment methods</a> that the
          merchant accepts and any associated <a>payment method</a> specific
          data (e.g., which credit card networks are supported).

        <h3>
          Describing what is being paid for
        </h3>
        <p>
          When constructing a new {{PaymentRequest}}, a merchant uses the
          second argument of the constructor (|details|) to provide the details
          of the transaction that the user is being asked to complete. This
          includes the total of the order and, optionally, some line items that
          can provide a detailed breakdown of what is being paid for.

          POSTing payment response back to a server

        <p>
          It's expected that data in a {{PaymentResponse}} will be POSTed back
          to a server for processing. To make this as easy as possible,
          {{PaymentResponse}} can use the [=default toJSON steps=] (i.e.,
          `.toJSON()`) to serializes the object directly into JSON. This makes
          it trivial to POST the resulting JSON back to a server using the

        <p>
          A developer creates a {{PaymentRequest}} to make a payment request.
          This is typically associated with the user initiating a payment
          process (e.g., by activating a "Buy," "Purchase," or "Checkout"
          button on a web site, selecting a "Power Up" in an interactive game,
          or paying at a kiosk in a parking structure). The {{PaymentRequest}}
          allows developers to exchange information with the <a>user agent</a>
          while the user is providing input (up to the point of user approval
          or denial of the payment request).
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        A |request|'s <dfn>payment-relevant browsing context</dfn> is that
        {{PaymentRequest}}'s [=relevant global object=]'s browsing context's
        <a>top-level browsing context</a>. Every <a>payment-relevant browsing
        context</a> has a <dfn>payment request is showing</dfn> boolean, which
        prevents showing more than one payment UI at a time.
      </p>
      <p class="Note">
        The <a>payment request is showing</a> boolean simply prevents more than
        one payment UI being shown in a single browser tab. However, a
        <a>payment handler</a> can restrict the <a>user agent</a> to showing
        only one payment UI across all browser windows and tabs. Other payment
        handlers might allow showing a payment UI across disparate browser
        tabs.

            "ecma-402#sec-iswellformedcurrencycode">well-formed</a> 3-letter
            alphabetic code (i.e., the numeric codes are not supported). Their
            canonical form is upper case. However, the set of combinations of
            currency code for which localized currency symbols are available is
            implementation dependent.
          </p>
          <p>
            When displaying a monetary value, it is RECOMMENDED that user
            agents display the currency code, but it's OPTIONAL for user agents
            to display a currency symbol. This is because currency symbols can
            be ambiguous due to use across a number of different currencies
            (e.g., "$" could mean any of USD, AUD, NZD, CAD, and so on.).
          </p>
          <p>
            User agents MAY format the display of the
            {{PaymentCurrencyAmount/currency}} member to adhere to OS
            conventions (e.g., for localization purposes).

          <div class="note" title=
          "Digital currencies and ISO 4217 currency codes">
            <p>
              User agents implementing this specification enforce [[ISO4217]]'s
              3-letter codes format via ECMAScriptâs <a data-cite=
              "ecma-402#sec-iswellformedcurrencycode">isWellFormedCurrencyCode</a>
              abstract operation, which is invoked as part of the <a>check and
              canonicalize amount</a> algorithm. When a code does not adhere to
              the [[ISO4217]] defined format, a {{RangeError}} is thrown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current implementations will therefore allow the use of
              well-formed currency codes that are not part of the official
              [[ISO4217]] list (e.g., XBT, XRP, etc.). If the provided code is
              a currency that the browser knows how to display, then an
              implementation will generally display the appropriate currency
              symbol in the user interface (e.g., "USD" is shown as U+0024
              Dollar Sign ($), "GBP" is shown as U+00A3 Pound Sign (Â£), "PLN"
              is shown as U+007A U+0142 ZÅoty (zÅ), and the non-standard "XBT"
              could be shown as U+0243 Latin Capital Letter B with Stroke (É)).
            </p>
            <p>
              Efforts are underway at ISO to account for digital currencies,
              which may result in an update to the [[ISO4217]] registry or an
              entirely new registry. The community expects this will resolve
              ambiguities that have crept in through the use of non-standard
              3-letter codes; for example, does "BTC" refer to Bitcoin or to a
              future Bhutan currency? At the time of publication, it remains
              unclear what form this evolution will take, or even the time
              frame in which the work will be completed. The W3C Web Payments
              Working Group is liaising with ISO so that, in the future,
              revisions to this specification remain compatible with relevant
              ISO registries.

            If a {{PaymentResponse}} is found to be erroneous (e.g., a payment
            instrument has expired or shipping information is invalid), the
            {{PaymentResponse/retry()}} method affords the end user the ability
            to fix input errors and try to get the merchant to processed the
            payment again. The passed {{PaymentValidationErrors}} serve as
            hints as to where input errors have occurred in the
            {{PaymentResponse}}, which the end user needs to correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, an end user may decide, upon inspection of the
            {{PaymentValidationErrors}}, to provide an entirely new set of
            values for the {{PaymentResponse}}. For example, the user might
            switch to a an entirely different payment instrument and/or provide
            an entirely different shipping address.
          </p>
          <p>
            As such, merchants need to be prepared to completely revalidate a
            {{PaymentResponse}} once the {{PaymentResponse/[[retryPromise]]}}
            settles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, as a {{PaymentResponse}} is inherently tied to a particular

              A general description of an error with the payment from which the
              user can attempt to recover. For example, the user may recover by
              retrying the payment. A developer can optionally pass the
              {{PaymentValidationErrors/error}} member on its own to give a
              general overview of validation issues, or it can be passed in
              combination with other members of the {{PaymentValidationErrors}}
              dictionary.

                  The language and direction of the
                  {{PaymentValidationErrors/error}} may often be determined
                  from information inherited from the document. However, this
                  approach may not suffice for some use cases. The working
                  group intends to fix this in a future version by aligning
                  with general approaches for the Web that are in development.

        <p class="note">
          The {{PaymentResponse/complete()}} method is called after the user
          has accepted the payment request and the
          {{PaymentRequest/[[acceptPromise]]}} has been resolved. Calling the
          {{PaymentResponse/complete()}} method tells the <a>user agent</a>
          that the payment interaction is over (and SHOULD cause any remaining
          user interface to be closed).
        </p>
        <p>
          After the payment request has been accepted and the
          {{PaymentResponse}} returned to the caller, but before the caller
          calls {{PaymentResponse/complete()}}, the payment request user
          interface remains in a pending state. At this point the user
          interface SHOULD NOT offer a cancel command because acceptance of the
          payment request has been returned. However, if something goes wrong
          and the developer never calls {{PaymentResponse/complete()}} then the
          user interface is blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, implementations MAY impose a timeout for developers
          to call {{PaymentResponse/complete()}}. If the timeout expires then
          the implementation will behave as if {{PaymentResponse/complete()}}
          was called with no arguments.

          <a>Payment method</a> owners establish the privacy policies for how
          user data collected for the payment method may be used. Payment
          Request API sets a clear expectation that data will be used for the
          purposes of completing a transaction, and user experiences associated
          with this API convey that intention. It is the responsibility of the
          payee to ensure that any data usage conforms to payment method
          policies. For any permitted usage beyond completion of the
          transaction, the payee should clearly communicate that usage to the

          In particular, the {{PaymentMethodData}}'s {{PaymentMethodData/data}}

          for the arbitrary exchange of data. In light of the wide range of
          data models used by existing payment methods, prescribing data
          specifics in this API would limit its usefulness. The
          {{PaymentResponse/details}} member carries data from the payment
          handler, whether Web-based (as defined by the [[[payment-handler]]])
          or proprietary. The [=user agent=] MUST NOT support payment handlers
          unless they include adequate user consent mechanisms (such as
          awareness of parties to the transaction and mechanisms for
          demonstrating the intention to share data).

          The {{PaymentMethodChangeEvent}} enables the payee to update the
          displayed total based on information specific to a selected
          <a>payment method</a>. For example, the billing address associated
          with a selected <a>payment method</a> might affect the tax
          computation (e.g., VAT), and it is desirable that the user interface
          accurately display the total before the payer completes the
          transaction. At the same time, it is desirable to share as little
          information as possible prior to completion of the payment.
          Therefore, when a <a>payment method</a> defines the <a>steps for when
          a user changes payment method</a>, it is important to minimize the
          data shared via the {{PaymentMethodChangeEvent}}'s
          {{PaymentMethodChangeEvent/methodDetails}} attribute. Requirements
          and approaches for minimizing shared data are likely to vary by
          <a>payment method</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where sharing of privacy-sensitive information might not be obvious
          to users (e.g., when [=payment handler/payment method changed
          algorithm | changing payment methods =]), it is RECOMMENDED that user
          agents inform the user of exactly what information is being shared
          with a merchant.

          <code>canMakePayment()</code> protections
        </h2>
        <p>
          The {{PaymentRequest/canMakePayment()}} method provides feature
          detection for different payment methods. It may become a
          fingerprinting vector if in the future, a large number of payment
          methods are available. purposes. User agents are expected to protect
          the user from abuse of the method. For example, user agents can
          reduce user fingerprinting by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rate-limiting the frequency of calls with different parameters.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For rate-limiting the user agent might look at repeated calls from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the same [=host/registrable domain=].
          </li>
          <li>the [=top-level browsing context=]. Alternatively, the user agent
          may block access to the API entirely for [=origins=] known to be bad
          actors.
          </li>
          <li>the [=origin=] of an [^iframe^] or popup window.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These rate-limiting techniques intend to increase the cost associated
          with repeated calls, whether it is the cost of managing multiple
          [=host/registrable domains=] or the user experience friction of
          opening multiple windows (tabs or pop-ups).

        There is only one class of product that can claim conformance to this
        specification: a <dfn>user agent</dfn>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Although this specification is primarily targeted at web browsers, it
        is feasible that other software could also implement this specification
        in a conforming manner.

      <p>
        User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this specification in any
        way desired, so long as the end result is indistinguishable from the
        result that would be obtained by the specification's algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        User agents MAY impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise
        unconstrained inputs, e.g., to prevent denial of service attacks, to
        guard against running out of memory, or to work around
        platform-specific limitations. When an input exceeds
        implementation-specific limit, the user agent MUST throw, or, in the
        context of a promise, reject with, a {{TypeError}} optionally informing
        the developer of how a particular input exceeded an
        implementation-specific limit.
