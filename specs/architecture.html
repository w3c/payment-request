        The Payment Request architecture is designed to separate different concerns of the
        Payment Request system into different specifications so that they can be discussed and moved
        forward independently. This document describes the architecture and explains what different
        specifications may be created and how the relate to each other.

        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of the Payment Request system is for a user agent to provide an abstract interface
        between a web page and a <a>payment app</a> to facilitate a payment transaction, for example
        between a merchant and a customer. A payment app allows the user to process a transaction
        with a <a>payment method</a> (though a payment app may support multiple payment methods).
        A user agent may support many different payment methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Payment Request architecture is designed to separate different concerns into
        different specifications so that they can be discussed and moved forward independently.
        The common component of each of the elements in the architecture is the payment method
        identifier. Payment method identifiers are defined in a separate document to which all other
        documents refer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The following diagram shows the references between different specifications that describe
        the Payment Request system. The arrows show normative references pointing from the referring
        document to the referenced document.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this architecture is to minimise cross-references to allow different documents
        to proceed at their own pace. The proposal makes the
        <a href="#payment-method-identifiers">Payment Method Identifiers</a> specification the only
        common dependency.

      <p>
        The following sections describe specifications that define the Payment Request architecture.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Method Identifiers</h2>
        <p>The Payment Method Identifiers [[METHODIDENTIFIERS]] specification defines the format of
        payment instrument identifiers. This document is a dependency for all other specifications
        in the architecture.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Request API</h2>
        <p>
        The Payment Request API [[PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] specification defines the API that makes a
        user agent the conduit for messages exchanged between web pages and <a>payment apps</a>.
        The web page supplies a list of payment methods accepted by the merchant. The user agent
        will match those against payment methods supported by the user’s registered payment apps.
        </p>
        <p>
        One principle of the Payment Request system is that when a merchant web site declares
        that it accepts a given payment method then it must know how to process the response that
        gets returned when the user accepts the request.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Method Registration Specifications</h2>
        <div class="issue" data-number="5" title="Payment instrument installation is platform-dependent">
          There is an open question within the working group about what registration scenarios
          should be supported by specifications from the group.
        </div>
        <p>
        The architecture highlights two possibilities for registration scenario. Other
        scenarios could be supported.
        </p>
        <p>
        One scenario is registering a new <a>payment app</a>. For example, this would allow bobspay.com
        to install an app into the user agent that would support transactions through the Payment
        Request API using the bobspay.com Payment Method Identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another scenario is that of registering specific <a>Payment Method Data</a> within a payment
        app. For example, this would allow a user logged in to the Alice Bank web site to register
        their Visa credit card with the Visa payment app.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Transaction Message Specifications</h2>
        <p>
        The abstract Payment Request API specification has no intrinsic knowledge of the payment
        methods available. When a transaction is enacted by the user through the API a JSON object
        containing the relevant information necessary to process the transaction is returned. The
        format of this "message" is defined specifically for the <a>payment method</a> and might be private
        to that method. However, we expect some message definitions to be shared amongst different
        <a>payment apps</a>. For example, we expect multiple different payment apps to support returning
        credit card PANs and they should all do so using the same field names.
        </p>

        <div class="issue" data-number="20" title="Standardizing Common Payment Instruments">
          There is an open issue highlighting that different card schemes have different manadatory
          requirements. This suggests that there might be a base credit card message format that supports
          the minimal set of required fields such as PAN and expiry date and other derived message formats
          based on the this that adds other fields such as start date.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Payment Method Identifier Registry</h2>
        <p>
        Payment Method Identifiers will support distributed extensibility, meaning that there does
        not need to be a central machine-readable registry to discover or register <a>payment methods</a>.
        For convenience, we may choose to host a Wiki page that allows developers of payment methods
        to publish links to their documentation including the format of payment request messages.
        The architecture diagram indicates this Wiki.
        <div class="issue" data-number="35" title="Should well-known identifiers be used for ubiquitous payment methods">
        If we choose to support well-known short strings for payment methods then we will need to
        determine where to define them. We may choose to define these well-known strings in a
        formal specification.
